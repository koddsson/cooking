    <h1>Watermelon-Basil Shrub</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 1/2 cups cubed watermelon</li>
<li>3/4 cup raw cane sugar</li>
<li>15-20 basil leaves (about 1/2 ounce), bruised</li>
<li>3/4 cup white wine vinegar</li>
</ul>
<h2>Process</h2>
<ol>
<li>Place watermelon and sugar into a medium bowl. Stir to combine. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator. Allow to macerate for up to 2 days.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, place basol leaves into a nonreactive container, cover with vinegar and store in a cool, dark place for up to 2 days. (The fridge is fine, but unnecessary.)</li>
<li>Pour watermelon mixture into a small bowl through a cheesecloth to remove solids.</li>
<li>Strain vinegar mixture throught the same cheesecloth, into same bowl as watermelon syrup. Allow to combine.</li>
<li>You may have some sugar clinging to the solids in the cheesecloth. If so, set the cheesecloth with the solids over another small bowl. Pour the syrup-and-vinegar mixture over the solids to wash the sugar into the bowl. Repeat as needed.</li>
<li>Squeeze the cheesecloth a bit to get the most out of the mixture.</li>
<li>Pour syrup-vinegar mixture into a clean mason jar. Cap it, shake it well to incorporate any undissolved sugar, and place in the refrigerator for a week before using.</li>
<li>Discard the solids or save them for another use.</li>
</ol>
