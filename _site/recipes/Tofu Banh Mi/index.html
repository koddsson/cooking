    <h1>Tofu Banh Mi</h1>
<h2>Marinated Tofu</h2>
<ul>
<li>~230 g extra firm tofu, drained and pressed</li>
<li>60 ml soy sauce</li>
<li>60 ml rice vinegar</li>
<li>60 ml maple syrup</li>
<li>2 tbsp sesame oil</li>
<li>2 tsp fresh grated ginger</li>
<li>1 tbsp cooking oil</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine all the ingredients for the tofu marinade EXPECT the cooking oil in a <strong>large, shallow dish</strong>. Slice the tofu into four slices and place in the marinade so that tofu is completely submerged.</p>
<p>Marinate for 1 hour or longer.</p>
<h2>Pickled Vegetables</h2>
<ul>
<li>1/3 large carrot, cut into matchsticks</li>
<li>1/2 small cucumber, cut into matchsticks</li>
<li>1/2 jalapeño, seeded and cut into thin rings</li>
<li>60 ml rice vinegar</li>
<li>1 tsp granulated sugar</li>
<li>0.5 tsp salt</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine the ingredients for the pickled vegetables in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.</p>
<h2>Creamy Bánh Mî Sauce</h2>
<ul>
<li>60 ml vegan mayonnaise</li>
<li>2 tsp hoisin sauce</li>
<li>1 tsp soy sauce</li>
<li>1 tsp maple syrup</li>
<li>1 tsp sriracha</li>
</ul>
<p>In a small bowl, whisk together the ingredients for the Creamy Banh Mi Sauce. Refrigerate until ready to use.</p>
<h2>The rest</h2>
<ul>
<li>12 inches baguette, cut in half</li>
<li>a few fresh sprigs of cilantro</li>
<li>1/4 jalapeño, seeded and cut into thin rings</li>
</ul>
<p>Once tofu is marinated, heat oil in a <strong>large skillet</strong> over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the tofu. Cook for about 5 minutes per side, until the tofu is dark and crispy.</p>
<p>Cut the baguette in half and then slice each baguette lengthwise to open. Generously spread the creamy Banh Mi sauce over both sides of each baguette. Add cooked tofu and a small handful of pickled carrots and cucumber. Top with fresh cilantro and jalapeño and serve immediately.</p>
