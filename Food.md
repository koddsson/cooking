# Food
I used to be a picky eater when I was a kid. I think I'm still in some ways a picky eater but I really try not to be. I feel a bit ashamed for flatly not liking some foods.

Some years ago I decided to try to consume as few animal products as I could. I specifically word my choice in this way because I don't like labels and don't like calling my self "a Vegan". I think there are a ton of emotions that people have put into this label and have made up their mind of what "a Vegan" before talking to you. It makes for boring conversations and some people trying to construct eloborate situations in where you'd consume an animal. I'm not a perfect Vegan so I don't call my self that. Sometimes I wear leather, sometimes wool. Sometimes I accidentally buy something with milk in it and then eat it. I don't want to have to defend who I am constantly so I call myself someone that "tries to consume as few animal products as possible".

So my recipies will either call for vegan ingredience specifically or just call milk, milk and when I'm making food, I'll use oat or soy or almond milk.

Since I moved to London some years ago I've really enjoyed eating Indian food. There's a vegeterian/vegan indian place in my neighborhood that's increadibly good.

I really love a good [Pizza](./Pizza.md) but it's hard for me to make at home. I always prefer pizzas made by someone with access to good sourdough and a wood fire oven. I've made some progress with a pizza stone, but I need to get better at making pizzas.
