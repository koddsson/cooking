# Tofu Banh Mi
## Ingredients
### Marinated Tofu
-   ~230 g extra firm tofu, drained and pressed
-   60 ml soy sauce
-   60 ml rice vinegar
-   60 ml maple syrup
-   2 tbsp sesame oil
-   2 tsp fresh grated ginger
-   1 tbsp cooking oil

### Creamy Bánh Mî Sauce
-   60 ml vegan mayonnaise
-   2 tsp hoisin sauce
-   1 tsp soy sauce
-   1 tsp maple syrup
-   1 tsp sriracha

### Pickled Vegetables
-   1/3 large carrot, cut into matchsticks
-   1/2 small cucumber, cut into matchsticks
-   1/2 jalapeño, seeded and cut into thin rings
-   60 ml rice vinegar
-   1 tsp granulated sugar
-   0.5 tsp salt

### Everything Else
-   12 inches baguette, cut in half
-   a few fresh sprigs of cilantro
-   1/4 jalapeño, seeded and cut into thin rings

## Instructions
-   Combine all the ingredients for the tofu marinade EXPECT the cooking oil in a **large, shallow dish**. Slice the tofu into four slices and place in the marinade so that tofu is completely submerged. Marinate for at least 1 hour.
-   Combine the ingredients for the pickled vegetables in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
-   In a small bowl, whisk together the ingredients for the Creamy Banh Mi Sauce. Refrigerate until ready to use.
-   Once tofu is marinated, heat oil in a **large skillet** over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the tofu. Cook for about 5 minutes per side, until the tofu is dark and crispy.
-   Cut the baguette in half and then slice each baguette lengthwise to open. Generously spread the creamy Banh Mi sauce over both sides of each baguette. Add cooked tofu and a small handful of pickled carrots and cucumber. Top with fresh cilantro and jalapeño and serve immediately.
