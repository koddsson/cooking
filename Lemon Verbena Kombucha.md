# Lemon Verbena Kombucha
## Ingredience
-   240 grams sugar
-   1.76 kilograms water
-   20 grams dried lemon verbena
-   200 grams unpasteurized kombucha (or the liquid that comes with  a packaged SCOBY)
-   1 SCOBY (a culture of bacteria and yeast that kickstarts the fermentation process - these are available to buy online)

## Steps
1. Water, SCOBY, lemon verbena, sugar,  and finished kombucha.
2. Make a syrup using the sugar and  an equal weight of water.
3. Combine the syrup and lemon verbena and allow to steep before adding the remaining water.
4. Strain the infusion through a fine-mesh sieve into the clean fermentation vessel.
5. Backslop with the unpasteurized kombucha.
6. Place the SCOBY into the fermentation vessel and cover.
7. Measure the sugar content using a refractometer (optional) and check again after 7 days.
8. Use pH strips to check the acidity of the kombucha. When the pH has reached 3.5 to 4, the kombucha should be close to ready.
9. Remove the SCOBY. Strain and bottle the kombucha.
