# Watermelon-Basil Shrub
## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups cubed watermelon
- 3/4 cup raw cane sugar
- 15-20 basil leaves (about 1/2 ounce), bruised
- 3/4 cup white wine vinegar

## Process
1. Place watermelon and sugar into a medium bowl. Stir to combine. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator. Allow to macerate for up to 2 days.
2. Meanwhile, place basol leaves into a nonreactive container, cover with vinegar and store in a cool, dark place for up to 2 days. (The fridge is fine, but unnecessary.)
3. Pour watermelon mixture into a small bowl through a cheesecloth to remove solids.
4. Strain vinegar mixture throught the same cheesecloth, into same bowl as watermelon syrup. Allow to combine.
5. You may have some sugar clinging to the solids in the cheesecloth. If so, set the cheesecloth with the solids over another small bowl. Pour the syrup-and-vinegar mixture over the solids to wash the sugar into the bowl. Repeat as needed.
6. Squeeze the cheesecloth a bit to get the most out of the mixture.
7. Pour syrup-vinegar mixture into a clean mason jar. Cap it, shake it well to incorporate any undissolved sugar, and place in the refrigerator for a week before using.
8. Discard the solids or save them for another use.
