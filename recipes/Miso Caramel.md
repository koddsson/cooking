# Miso Caramel
#TK: Image
## Ingredience
-   3/4 cup sugar  
-   1/4 cup water  
-   1/2 cup double cream  
-   2 tablespoons white [miso](./Miso.md)

## Method
1. In a heavy saucepan set over medium-high heat, stir together sugar and water. Without additional stirring, bring the mixture to a boil. Use a wet pastry brush to wash down any sugar crystals that form on the sides of the pan. When sugar becomes a deep golden brown, remove the pan from heat.
2. Once the pan is off the heat, pour in the cream, which will cause the caramel to bubble. Stir to combine. If the caramel seizes up and hardens with the addition of the cold cream, then put the pan back over low heat and stir until the caramel is liquid again. Whisk in the miso. Allow caramel to cool before pouring it into a container and store in the refrigerator.
