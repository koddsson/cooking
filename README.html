<h1>cooking</h1>
<p>This is where I archive recipes.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> for writing recipies, <a href="https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git">obsidian-git</a> for syncing to GitHub and then I wrote a GitHub action to change Obsidian style links to markdown links.</p>
<p>There are two branches in this repository.</p>
<p>The branch that I work out of is <a href="https://github.com/koddsson/cooking/tree/main"><code>main</code></a> which includes Obsidian markdown formatted files. It also includes a github action to convert Obsidian WikiLinks to markdown links and then push that change to the <code>view</code> branch.</p>
<p>The default branch is <a href="https://github.com/koddsson/cooking/tree/view"><code>view</code></a> which is a build artifact from the github action run in <code>main</code>.</p>
