# Tofu Pepper Fry
This is one of my favorites, I haven't had the original in Dishoom since it has meat. The original recipie is a Mutton Pepper Fry but I've just replace the meat with Tofu. The rest of the recipe is already vegan.

This recipie also introduced me to parathas which is now my favorite.

I'd make the spice masala in advance since it takes a bit of time to toast the spices and then cool them down completely.

Serves 4.

## Ingredients

### Spice masala
- 3 dried read chilis
- 1 small cinnamon stick
- 18g coriander seeds
- 10g black peppercorns
- 1tsp fennel seeds
- 1 clove
- 4 fresh curry leaves

### Tofu Marinade

- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1tsp fine sea salt

### Curry
- 60ml vegetable oil
- 1/2 tsp mustard seeds
- 8 fresh curry leaves
- 3 dried red chilis
- 200g red onions, finely diced
- 15g ginger paste [^note-on-ginger-and-garlic-paste]
- 15g garlic paste [^note-on-ginger-and-garlic-paste]
- 1 tsp deggi mirch chilli powder
- 3g long pepper powder
- 10g freshly ground black pepper

## Method
1. For the spice masala, put the ingredients into a dry, heavy-based frying pan then place over a medium heat, so the spices gradually warm with the pan. Gently toast for 1-2 minutes, until you just start to smell the spices. Tip out onto a plate and allow to cool completely, then grind to a fine powder, using a pestle and mortar. I also use a spice grinder to help me out with the grinding.
2. For the marinade, mix the ingredients together in a large bowl. Add the tofu pieces and turn them to coat all over. Cover and leave to marinate in a cool place for 2 hours, while you prepare the curry base.
3. For the curry, warm a heavey-based saucepan over a medium-high heat and add the oil. Add the mustard seeds, curry leaves and dried red chillies and let them sizzle for 1 minute, or until the mustard seeds start to pop, whichever is the shorter time.
4. Add the red onions and sauté over a medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until dark brown, 20-25 minutes.
5. Stir in the ginger and garlic pastes and continue to sauté for 3-4 minutes, until the garlic is very lightly browned, stirring almost continuously so that it doesn't burn.
6. Add the chilli powder, tumeric, 1.5 tsp salt, all the pepper and 15g of the spice masala. (Keep the rest in a jar for another use.) Cook for 2 minutes, then add 50ml water and stir well to create a thick, pliable paste. Turn the heat right down and cook for a further 10 minutes, stirring regularly, until the oil seperates from the spices.
7. Chop the tomatoes, add to the curry and cook over a medium heat for 20-25 minutes. Add a small splash of water whenever the pan starts to dry. The tomatoes need to completely disintegrate and build up a good color.
8. Add the marinated tofu to the sauce along with 150-200ml water. Bring to a simmer and simmer gently for a couple of hours. Top up with a little water now and then, if you need to. (The original recipie calls for 2 hours but I tend to make a big batch and after all this I'm hungry and want to eat so I have a serving right away and then let it simmer for some hours)
9. When the curry is almost ready, heat the oil in a small frying pan over a medium-high heat, add the curry leaves and fry for 1 minute until crisp.
10. Stir the chopped coriander through the curry. Serve in deep bowls dotted with the fried curry leaves, with coriander on the side, lemon wedges for squeezing and plenty of parathas to mop up the rich sauce.
